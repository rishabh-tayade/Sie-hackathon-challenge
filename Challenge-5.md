# Challenge 5 - Build Your Own AI-Powered Project

## Background
In this challenge, you'll demonstrate your ability to create a complete project using GitHub Copilot as your AI pair programmer. You'll define your own problem statement and use AI to help with architecture decisions, coding, testing, and documentation.

## Objective
Create a well-structured, production-ready application that solves a problem of your choice, utilizing GitHub Copilot throughout the development process.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Problem Definition
- Choose a problem that can be completed in 2-3 hours
- Document your problem statement in README.md
- Use Generative AI in the solution
- Let GitHub Copilot help decide your architecture and tech stack

### 2. Code Quality
- Maintain consistent coding style
- Create modular & scalable code with clear separation of concerns
  - Separate services, controllers, routes
  - Use appropriate design patterns
- Ensure code readability & maintainability
  - Clear function names
  - Proper comments
  - Logical structure

### 3. Documentation
- Generate comprehensive code comments using Copilot
- Create detailed markdown documentation
- Generate a mermaid diagram for your project architecture
- Document all Copilot Chat prompts and responses

### 4. Testing & CI/CD
- Implement unit tests
- Add integration tests
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Ensure all tests pass

### 5. Version Control
- Write informative commit messages
- Submit detailed Pull Requests
- Use GitHub Copilot for code reviews

## Evaluation Criteria
